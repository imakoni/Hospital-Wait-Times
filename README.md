 Hospital-Wait-Times

Outpatient Hospital Wait Time Analysis Project – Optimizing efficient healthcare service delivery

The timely delivery of patient care services had been a significant issue within the healthcare industry. Long wait times have resulted in increased patient frustration and a negative outlook toward patient care delivery and a loss of revenue for healthcare organizations.

What influenced me to work on this project was:

1.)	My clients on therapy caseload miss treatment sessions due to waiting longer than expected during an outpatient patient visit, therefore loss in billable services and revenue. 

2.)	Clients are too tired to participate returning from appointments due to prolonged wait times.


Objective

To analyze factors impacting the  efficient patient care delivery thereby resulting in increased wait times. An interactive  dashboard was designed in Tableau Desktop to provide insight on strategies to miniminize wait times, improve client satisfaction and overall revenue.  This project provides insights to improve resource allocation and financial outcomes for the hospital management team.

Dataset/Data cleaning

The dataset in Excel consisted of approximately 30,000 visits recorded by an outpatient hospital within two weeks. I was able to conduct the data cleaning process involving replacing missing values, formatting the dates, and converting wait time to minutes and days of visits before creating a database and loading data into MSSS.

Data Exploration

Lastly, I was able to run SQL queries to determine the following:

•	Average wait time per financial class (Insurance plan).

•	Revenue generated per patient based on financial class (Insurance plan).

•	The type of physician and number of patients seen per day.

•	Length of wait time based on the day of the week.

Key Takeaways

•	Private insurance clients experienced the lowest average wait times of 48 minutes and coincidentally generated the most revenue for the facility.
  
•	There is a disproportionate distribution in patient to physician ratios-Anchor physicians provided care to most patients at 21,913 during this period.
  
•	Most appointments scheduled for the beginning of the week withMonday being the busiest day with an average of 101k patients and a wait time of 49mins.

Recommendations

•	Using mobile apps for scheduling appointments and extended features that include real-time updates to provide information about the approximate wait times upon     reaching the hospital.
 
•	Telehealth solutions/virtual care eliminates travel time and expenses, waiting in line for prolonged periods before receiving care.
 
•	Improving staffing methods- providing support for physicians by hiring Physician’s Assistants and Nurse Practitioners to reduce the doctors’caseloads.
